## Dynamic RNN and GRU with Tensorflow Higher Order Ops

These RNN and GRU is implemented with 8 by 8 MNIST dataset for checking. 


This repository contains the simple example of dynamic seqence and batch vhanilla RNN and GRU written in tensorflow using scan and map ops.

Every folder contains with .python file and ipython notebook for convenience.

This examples gives a very good understanding of the implementation of Dynamic RNN in tensorflow.
These code can be extended to create neural stack machine, neural turing machine, RNN-EMM in tensorflow.
