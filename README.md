## Dynamic RNN and GRU with Tensorflow Higher Order Ops

This repository contains the simple example of dynamic seqence and batch vhanilla RNN and GRU written in tensorflow using scan and map ops.

Every folder contains with .py, .ipynb and .html of same RNN and GRU for convenience.

This examples gives a very good understanding of the implementation of Dynamic RNN in tensorflow.
These code can be extended to create neural stack machine, neural turing machine, RNN-EMM in tensorflow.
